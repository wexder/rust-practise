# Rust practice
Practicing rust by implementing datastructures.

## Lists
### Single linked list
Not optimal implementation of linked list. Double linked list should be prefered.
This was strugle, the reference nature of linked list is really hard for beginer to implement in rust.
Current implemention is missing ways to delete from list and leaks memory.

TODO:
- Pop/delete 
- Memory cleaning when dropped 
- More tests

### Array list/Vec
Super simple Array list/Vec implementation, not fully complete and definetly safe to use. But fun to play around with pointers.
It was interesting to see you cannot resize array in Rust.

TODO:
- More tests


Note:
Datastructures might not be implemented fully correctly, do not use this as reference.
There are better datastructure implementation.
